Specific project related to multimedia, Extraction, Image Processing, Search algorithms, Relevancy Feedback mechanisms, etc.

## Projects:
*Variable Message Sign detection and classification [VMS_detection]:* 
- Implementation of processing pipeline using various Machine Learning algorithms for detection of Variable Message Signs in an image. Includes methods for segmenting images as well as classifying them with a pre-trained XGBoost model from images scraped from Google Images and manually classified. 

*Content Based Image Retrieval System with Relevancy Feedback [CBIR_rf]:* 
- A content-based image retrieval system which calculates similarity metrics based on color and / or intensity profiles of image database and has variable weight applied based on retrieve . Must be built from src, instructions included in sub-folder 

*Machine Learning Audio Classifier* This is a GUI developed with PyQt5 for interacting with pretrained machine learning models to test functionality of classifiers on detecting whether audio files contain music or speech.
