Specific project related to multimedia, Extraction, Image Processing, Search algorithms, Relevancy Feedback mechanisms, etc.

## Projects:
* **CBIR_basic:** basic content-based image retrieval system which calculates similarity metrics based on color and / or intensity profiles of image database. Must be built from src, instructions included in sub-folder 
* **VMS_detection:** Implementation of processing pipeline implementing Machine Learning algorithm for detection of Variable Message Signs in an image. Includes methods for segmenting images as well as classifying them with a pre-trained XGBoost model from images scraped from Google Images and manually classified.
